# Using Trends to Predict Video Game Profitability  
By: Alex Bonczkiewicz

With so many games being released under different categories, we need to figure out which features lead a game to the top. When trying to understand what makes a video game popular and successful, I have collected open-source data to build eda plots, multiple linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models to predict which factors lead to success. The final machine learning model has an RME of 1.8. These models performed okay and ensured the original prediction of which features make a game popular. Predicting that Genre, Publisher, and Year of Release are the greatest factors when deciding what makes a game popular.

Business Understanding- New Gaming Company is trying to break out into the industry and create a successful game. Understanding which features can influence the popularity of a game can greatly benefit this company,i.e., increased revenue, increased popularity of company, establish a presence in the gaming industry.

Data Understanding - This Kaggle dataset is suitable as it contains a plethora of game data from from popular streaming sites. We will explore the data, build machine learning models, and evaluate the performance of the models. Focused on Genre, Publisher, Title, and Year of Release as features of measurement and comparison. 

Data cleaning will take place in order to narrow the data down into a digestable format, excluding the attributes that we are not focusing on. A model was made to show any outliers; looked at how the outliers impacted the data. 

Modeling - Performed Linear Multiple Regression, Decision Tree regression, and Random forest tree models. They performed well compared to my baseline prediction.

Conclusion- The EDA plots and Regression models are most helpful as they show which features made up popular games in the past, however, there are still limitations. While creating Shooter and Platform games and releasing them on all current generation platforms is a great start, it would be good to build on that by looking into more data. With factors like games being released for free suddenly on the rise and the impact that has on the global sales data, as well as the cost of creating different types of games and the overall ROI. 


Navigation - (Goodluck...) Navigating the notebook will be the most difficult as there are a lot of lines that must be ran in different order. However, all code was at some-point executed and used. There is an AI_Capstone_2 folder within the original folder that is empty. 

-----I think my biggest challenge in this project was a limit of time, and poor planning/ preperation. (the latter was my doing) -----
