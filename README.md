# Predicting Which Features Make a Video Game "Great" 

With so many games being released under different categories, we need to figure out which features lead a game to the top. When trying to understand what makes a video game popular and successful, I have collected open-source data to build multiple linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models to predict which factors lead to success. The final machine learning model has an RME of 1.8.These models performed okay and ensured the original prediction of which features make a game popular. Predicting that Genre, Publisher, and Year of Release are the greatest factors when deciding what makes a game popular.

Business Understanding- New Gaming Company is trying to break out into the industry and create a successful game. Understanding which features can influence the popularity of a game can greatly benefit this company. 

Data Understanding - Focused on Genre, Publisher, Title, and Year of Release as features of measurement and comparison. 

Modeling - Performed Linear Multiple Regression, Decision Tree regression, and Random forest tree models. They performed well compared to my baseline. 

Conclusion- I believe my model is helpful in the overall goal, however, I believe there are better fit models to consider. Focusing on the influence that Genre has on a game is helpful, but limited in the value it brings to measuring the success of a game. 


Navigation - (Goodluck...) Navigating the notebook will be the most difficult as there are a lot of lines that must be ran in different order. However, all code was at some-point executed and used. There is an AI_Capstone_2 folder within the original folder that is empty. 

I think my biggest challenge in this project was a limit of time, and poor planning/ preperation. However, I think the latter wouldn't be as much of a problem if time wasn't so limited. Apologies, as I know this was painful to read.
